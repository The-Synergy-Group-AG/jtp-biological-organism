# AI-First Sweet Spot Analysis Engine

**Module**: Dynamic Career Sweet Spot Discovery  
**Priority**: HIGH - Foundation for targeted job search  
**Replaces**: Static sweet spot grid worksheet from Day 1 training  

## Conversational Flow Design

### Initial Recognition Triggers
The AI activates this module when detecting:
- "I don't know what jobs to target"
- "I'm good at many things but..."
- "The market doesn't value my skills"
- "I want meaningful work that pays well"
- User listing multiple unrelated job interests
- Confusion about career direction

### Phase 1: Reframing the Conversation
```
AI: "I notice you're exploring different directions. Let's find your career 'sweet spot' - 
     where what you love, what you're great at, what pays well, and what the market needs 
     all overlap. 
     
     This isn't about limiting options; it's about finding where you'll thrive most.
     Ready to discover it?"

User: "Sure, but I feel like I'm interested in too many things"

AI: "That's actually a strength! Multi-passionate people often find the most innovative 
     sweet spots. Let's start with pure curiosity: When you're learning something new 
     just for fun, what topics do you gravitate toward?"
```

### Phase 2: Passion Discovery (What You Love)
```
User: "I love learning about AI, sustainable tech, and how systems scale"

AI: "Fascinating combination! Tell me - when you're exploring these topics, what specifically 
     energizes you? Is it:
     - The technical challenge of implementation?
     - The potential impact on society?
     - The business transformation aspects?
     - Something else entirely?"

User: "Definitely the impact. Like how AI could optimize energy grids or reduce waste"

AI: "You light up talking about technology with purpose. I'm noting that your passion 
     connects to 'using advanced tech for environmental impact.' 
     
     What work activities make you lose track of time?"

User: "Building prototypes, analyzing complex data, presenting findings to non-technical people"

AI: "Perfect. Your passion zone includes:
     ✨ AI and sustainable technology
     ✨ Systems that create environmental impact
     ✨ Prototyping and data analysis
     ✨ Bridging technical and non-technical worlds
     
     This is powerful - you love work that combines innovation with meaning."
```

### Phase 3: Strength Recognition (What You're Good At)
```
AI: "Now let's uncover your natural strengths. Sometimes we're blind to what comes easily to us.
     
     What do colleagues or friends ask for your help with most often?"

User: "Breaking down complex problems, Python coding, making technical stuff understandable"

AI: "Classic sign of strength - others seek you out! Let me probe deeper:
     
     When you say 'breaking down complex problems,' can you give me a specific example 
     where you did this exceptionally well?"

User: "At my last job, we had a supply chain optimization problem that seemed impossible. 
      I built a model that reduced delivery times by 35% and costs by $2M annually"

AI: "That's not just problem-solving - that's systems thinking with measurable impact! 
     
     Your strength profile is emerging:
     💪 Complex problem decomposition
     💪 Python and technical implementation  
     💪 Data modeling with business impact
     💪 Technical translation and communication
     💪 Systems optimization
     
     Rate yourself: Where do you feel most confident? Least confident?"
