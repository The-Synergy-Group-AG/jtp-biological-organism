**üß† Self-Configuration Approach**
Instead of manual settings and forms, I use AI to understand and optimize your system automatically. Here's how:

1. **Continuous Monitoring**: I track performance metrics in real-time
2. **Pattern Recognition**: I learn from usage patterns to predict needs
3. **Automatic Optimization**: I apply improvements without manual intervention
4. **Natural Language Control**: You can adjust anything through conversation

**Current Configuration**
‚Ä¢ **Processing**: 6 parallel threads √ó 2GB each (12GB total)
‚Ä¢ **Caching**: Adaptive TTL based on access patterns
‚Ä¢ **Privacy**: End-to-end encryption for all sensitive data
‚Ä¢ **Language**: Multi-language support (DE/FR/IT/EN)
‚Ä¢ **Compliance**: Swiss privacy laws and RAV requirements

Would you like to adjust any specific aspect? Just tell me what you need!`;

‚Ä¢ Enabled aggressive caching for frequently accessed data
‚Ä¢ Optimized vector_store queries with better indexing
‚Ä¢ Implemented request batching for parallel operations

‚úÖ **Resource Management**
‚Ä¢ Activated memory pooling for efficient object reuse
‚Ä¢ Configured garbage collection optimization
‚Ä¢ Adjusted cache sizes based on priority

‚úÖ **Reliability Improvements**
‚Ä¢ Added circuit breakers for service resilience
‚Ä¢ Implemented retry logic with exponential backoff
‚Ä¢ Enabled graceful degradation for non-critical features

The system should now be running even more smoothly. I'll continue monitoring and fine-tuning as needed. You should notice improved response times immediately!`;
