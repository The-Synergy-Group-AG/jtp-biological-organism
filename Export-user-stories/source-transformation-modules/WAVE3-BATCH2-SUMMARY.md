## Architecture Patterns

All modules follow the established Wave 3 patterns:

1. **Zero Forms**: Everything through natural conversation
2. **Privacy First**: On-device processing, minimal data storage
3. **6Ã—2GB Threading**: Optimized for parallel processing
4. **Unified Experience**: All modules integrate with UnifiedExperience
5. **Natural Language**: No technical jargon, conversational interfaces

## Integration Points

### UnifiedExperience as Central Hub
- All modules register with UnifiedExperience
- Single conversation thread routes to appropriate modules
- Context maintained across module boundaries
- Natural transitions between features

### Module Communication
```typescript
// Each module registers like this:
global.unifiedExperience.registerModule('ModuleName', {
  handleUnified: async (params) => { /* handle request */ },
  getState: async (userId) => { /* return current state */ },
  getWelcomeContext: async () => { /* return welcome message */ }
});
```

## Usage Examples

### CommunicationIntelligence
```
User: "I need to write a follow-up email to the recruiter from TechCorp"
AI: "I'll help you compose that follow-up. What's the main purpose - checking on application status, providing additional information, or scheduling next steps?"
```

### RelationshipIntelligence
```
User: "Who should I reconnect with for my job search?"
AI: "Based on your network, here are high-priority reconnections:
- Sarah (recruiter) - Last contact 45 days ago
- Mike (mentor) - Strong connection, could provide referrals
- Lisa (peer at target company) - Inside knowledge opportunity"
```

### UnifiedExperience
```
User: "What should I focus on today?"
AI: "Based on your recent activity:
1. You have 2 applications with upcoming deadlines
2. It's been a week since you updated your resume
3. Morning is your most productive time - perfect for deep work
What would you like to tackle first?"
```

### EffortCompanion
```
User: "I just spent 2 hours on job applications"
AI: "Great work on job applications! That's 2 hours of focused effort. 
ðŸŽ‰ Milestone: You've now dedicated 10+ hours to applications this week!
What are you working on next?"
```

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Create test suites for conversational flows
2. **Integration**: Connect with existing Wave 1 and Wave 2 modules
3. **Enhancement**: Add more natural language understanding capabilities
4. **Privacy**: Implement full encryption for sensitive data
5. **Performance**: Optimize thread pool usage across modules
