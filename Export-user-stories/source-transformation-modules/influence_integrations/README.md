## Integration Guide

### Basic Usage

```python
from influence_integrations import SubscriptionOptimizer, UserContext

# Initialize optimizer
optimizer = SubscriptionOptimizer()

# Create user context
user = UserContext(
    user_id="user_123",
    engagement_level=0.85,
    feature_usage={"applications": 47, "analytics": 12},
    goals=["land dream job", "6-figure salary"],
    subscription_tier="free",
    # ... other parameters
)

# Generate ethical offer
offer = optimizer.generate_ethical_offer(user)

# Deliver through conversation
conversation = optimizer.deliver_offer_conversation(offer, user)
```

### Ethical Guidelines

All modules follow these ethical principles:

1. **User Benefit First**: Every influence mechanic must create genuine value
2. **Transparency**: No hidden manipulation or dark patterns
3. **Respect Boundaries**: Honor user preferences and limits
4. **Measure Ethics**: Track pressure levels and satisfaction
5. **Long-term Thinking**: Optimize for relationship quality over quick wins

### Metrics & Monitoring

Each module tracks both business and ethical metrics:

**Business Metrics**:
- Conversion rates
- Retention improvements
- Viral coefficients
- Revenue impact
- Time to conversion

**Ethical Metrics**:
- User satisfaction scores
- Pressure/manipulation indices
- Trust scores
- Value delivery ratings
- Long-term retention quality

### Conversation Examples

#### Subscription Optimizer
```
System: "Hey! Noticed you've been crushing it lately ðŸŽ¯"
System: "You've Invested in Your Career Growth"
System: "You've tracked 47 applications and spent 156.5 hours improving your job search..."
System: "Ready to level up? Here's your personalized Pro plan: (Trial ends in 3 days)"
```

#### Referral Amplifier
```
System: "ðŸŒŸ John, you're now a JTP Champion!"
System: "Your 12 successful job placements have inspired 4 professionals in your network."
System: "Sarah Chen landed her dream role at Google using your interview framework."
System: "Share your secret weapon? You'll both get Pro features when she joins."
```

#### Engagement Sustainer
```
System: "Don't lose your progress! ðŸš¨"
System: "You're about to lose your 12-day streak!"
System: "Just 2 minutes today keeps everything on track."
```

### Testing & Optimization

Each module includes:
- A/B testing frameworks
- Performance analysis tools
- Ethical boundary validators
- Optimization recommendation engines

### Best Practices

1. **Start Conservative**: Begin with lighter triggers and escalate based on response
2. **Monitor Continuously**: Watch both performance and ethical metrics
3. **Personalize Deeply**: Use user context for relevant triggers
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Validate both effectiveness and user satisfaction
5. **Iterate Based on Feedback**: Let user responses guide optimization

## Future Enhancements
