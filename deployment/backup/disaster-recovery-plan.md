1. Check service health: `kubectl get pods -n biological-production`
2. Identify failed pod: `kubectl describe pod <failed-pod> -n biological-production`
3. Restart failed pod: `kubectl delete pod <failed-pod> -n biological-production`
4. Verify recovery: `kubectl logs <new-pod> -n biological-production`

### PROCEDURE 2: NODE FAILURE RECOVERY
1. Drain failed node: `kubectl drain <failed-node> --ignore-daemonsets`
2. Check node status: `kubectl get nodes`
3. Reschedule workloads: `kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o wide`
4. Uncordon node when recovered: `kubectl uncordon <recovered-node>`

### PROCEDURE 3: CLUSTER FAILURE RECOVERY
1. Assess cluster status: `kubectl cluster-info`
2. Restore from latest backup using backup-script.sh
3. Redeploy services: `kubectl apply -f deployment/kubernetes/`
4. Verify full system restoration

### PROCEDURE 4: DATA RECOVERY
1. Identify affected data services
2. Restore from latest backup
3. Replicate data from healthy nodes
4. Validate data integrity through health checks

## PREVENTION MEASURES
