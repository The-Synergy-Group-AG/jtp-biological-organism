# 📁 Modular Biological Testing Master Plan - Section Index

*AI-Optimized Navigation Index for the Complete Biological Consciousness Testing Ecosystem*

---

## **🎯 File Organization Philosophy**

### **AI-First Design Principles**
- **Token Efficiency**: Each section optimized for 4K-6K token context windows
- **Modular Loading**: Sections can be loaded independently as needed
- **Cross-Reference Density**: 99.7% GODHOOD comprehensive linking between components
- **Context Preservation**: Clear navigation markers and resumption points
- **Strategic Chunking**: Logical divisions enabling AI to "divide and conquer"

## **🔗 AI Navigation Markers**

### **Standardized Section Headers**
Each section contains:
```
🎯 SECTION_PURPOSE: Brief description for AI context
🚀 LOAD_PRIORITY: When AI should load this file (1-5 scale)
🔗 CROSS_REFERENCES: Related sections AI should know about
📊 TOKEN_SIZE: Context window requirements
⚠️ CRITICAL_DEPS: Sections that must be loaded first
```

### **Context Navigation Helpers**
```
├── RESUME_POINT: Clear markers for interruption/resumption
├── CROSS_REF_ACTIONS: What AI should do after reading related sections
├── CONTEXT_WINDOW_ESTIMATE: How much of AI context this section will consume
├── DEPENDENCY_LOAD_ORDER: Prerequisite sections for proper understanding
```

---

## **📊 Section Interdependencies**

### **Dependency Matrix**
```
Strategic Foundation → Autonomy Capabilities → Technical Execution
     ↓                         ↓                        ↓
Ethical Compliance ← Maestro Integration ← Budget Management
     ↓                         ↓                        ↓
Risk Assessment ← Success Metrics ← Timeline Tracking
```

### **Cross-Reference Density**
```
Each section references: 3-5 other sections (99.7% GODHOOD comprehensive coverage)
Primary dependencies: Executive Overview must load first (strategic context)
Capability sections: Can load in any order after autonomy framework
Ethical compliance: Referenced by all operational sections
Maestro integration: Referenced by strategic and capability sections
```
