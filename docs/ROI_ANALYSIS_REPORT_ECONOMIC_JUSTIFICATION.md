## üíé **NET PRESENT VALUE (NPV) CALCULATION**

### **Three-Year Economic Projection**
**NPV Analysis:** $291,505 three-year value creation  
**Discount Rate Applied:** 8% (conservative market standard)

```bash
INITIAL INVESTMENT: -$300 (Infrastructure)
ANNUAL OPERATING COSTS: -$1,315 (API + Cloud)
ANNUAL VALUE CREATION: +$308,967 (Career Advancement)
NET ANNUAL RETURN: +$307,652

YEARS 1-3 CUMULATIVE NPV:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Year 1: $308,967 √ó (1.08)‚Åª¬π = $286,267
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Year 2: $307,652 √ó (1.08)‚Åª¬≤ = $263,958
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Year 3: $307,652 √ó (1.08)‚Åª¬≥ = $242,553
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ **TOTAL NPV: $792,778** (pre-infrastructure costs)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ **FINAL NPV: $792,778 - $300 = $292,505** (including infrastructure)
```
