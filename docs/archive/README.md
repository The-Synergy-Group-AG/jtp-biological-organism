### Date Archived: October 27, 2025

### Reason for Archiving:
These files contained incomplete, malformed, or outdated user stories with:
- Non-descriptive titles (like "to US-XXX", "13 âœ… Complete")
- Missing or incomplete descriptions
- Poor organization and navigation
- Inconsistent formats

### Replacement:
These files have been replaced by the new definitive collection:
- `../COMPLETE_USER_STORIES_MASTER_LIST.md` - Master 442-story list with proper titles and descriptions
- `../COMPLETE_USER_STORIES_MASTER_LIST.csv` - CSV version for import
- `../categories/` - Organized 8-category structure with proper navigation

### Note:
This archive is preserved for historical reference. All current development should use the files in the parent directory and the categories folder.
