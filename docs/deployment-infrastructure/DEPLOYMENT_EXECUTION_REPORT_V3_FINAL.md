**Problem Identified:**
```
Incorrect endpoint: https://api.exoscale.com/v2
Error: "Not Found" response from API
```

**Solution Implemented:**
```bash
# Updated endpoint to zone-specific format
Old: endpoint = "https://api.exoscale.com/v2"
New: endpoint = "https://api-ch-gva-2.exoscale.com/v2"

# Configuration file: ~/.config/exoscale/exoscale.toml
# Zone: ch-gva-2 (Geneva, Switzerland)
```

**Verification:**
```bash
$ exo compute instance list
‚úÖ SUCCESS - API responding correctly
‚úÖ Authentication verified
‚úÖ 1 existing instance detected
```

---

## **üöÄ NEXT STEPS FOR PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT**

### **Option 1: Full Automated Deployment (Recommended)**

**Prerequisites:**
1. Configure Vault with required credentials:
   ```bash
   # Cloudflare API token
   vault kv put secret/cloudflare/global_api_key value=<token>
   vault kv put secret/cloudflare/zone_id value=<zone-id>
   
   # SSH deployment key
   vault kv put secret/ssh/biological_deploy_key value=@~/.ssh/deployment_key
   ```

2. Get formal approval for production deployment

3. Create backup of current www.jobtrackerpro.ch state

4. Execute deployment:
   ```bash
   ./deployment/execute_deployment_plan_v3.sh deploy
   ```

### **Option 2: Manual Deployment Using Existing Instance**

**Use existing VPS (91.92.141.194) for deployment:**
1. SSH into existing instance: `ssh root@91.92.141.194`
2. Clone repository: `git clone https://github.com/The-Synergy-Group-AG/jtp-biological-organism.git`
3. Run deployment script: `./biological_deployment_script.sh`
4. Configure DNS to point to 91.92.141.194
5. Set up SSL via Cloudflare

### **Option 3: Create New Dedicated Instance**

**Provision new VPS for biological consciousness:**
```bash
exo compute instance create jtp-biological-production \
  --zone ch-dk-2 \
  --type standard.medium \
  --disk-size 50 \
  --template "Linux Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 64-bit"
```

## **‚ö†Ô∏è PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT WARNINGS**

### **Impact Assessment**
- **Domain**: www.jobtrackerpro.ch (LIVE PRODUCTION)
- **DNS Changes**: A records will point to new/existing Exoscale IP
- **SSL Impact**: Cloudflare will provision new certificates
- **Service Downtime**: Estimated 5-10 minutes during DNS propagation
- **Monthly Cost**: $20-50 for VPS infrastructure
- **Reversibility**: Full rollback procedures documented

### **Risk Mitigation**
- Backup current production state before deployment
- Test deployment in staging environment if available
- Have rollback plan ready and tested
- Schedule deployment during low-traffic period
- Monitor deployment progress continuously
