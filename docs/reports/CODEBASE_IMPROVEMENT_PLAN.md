- **Primary Issues**: Extensive debug print usage (118 files), import inconsistencies, code organization
- **Strengths**: Comprehensive test coverage structure, extensive documentation, graceful fallback mechanisms
- **Tech Stack**: FastAPI/Python backend, Docker deployment, multiple AI integrations
