- Enter email, password, name
- Check GDPR consent box
- Click "Register" button
```

**AI-First Conversation**:
```
User: "I'd like to start tracking my job search"
AI: "Welcome! I'm here to help you succeed in your job search journey. I'm JTP, your personal career assistant. What should I call you?"
User: "I'm Sarah"
AI: "Nice to meet you, Sarah! I'll create your personal job tracking space. I'll send you a quick verification to sarah.chen@email.com (I noticed that from your device). Is that correct?"
User: "Yes, that's right"
AI: "Perfect! I've sent a verification. While we wait, tell me - what kind of role are you looking for? This helps me personalize your experience."
User: "I'm a software engineer looking for senior positions"
AI: "Excellent! I'll optimize your dashboard for senior software engineering roles. I've already started gathering market insights for you. Check your email to complete setup!"
```

### US-003: Dashboard Overview

DeepMind moved you to final round (congrats!), and both Stripe and Figma want to schedule interviews. You're tracking 47 active applications, with 8 in late stages.

What would you like to focus on today?"
User: "Show me the responses"
AI: "Here are your hot leads:
1. **DeepMind** - ML Engineer role ‚Üí Final round scheduled for Thursday 2pm
2. **Stripe** - Senior Backend ‚Üí They're impressed! Available slots: Mon-Wed afternoons

I'm creating a separate tracking space for PM positions. This keeps your engineering applications organized while you explore product.

What attracts you to product management?"
User: "I want more strategic impact and work closer with customers"
AI: "That's a powerful motivation! I'll tailor your PM search to roles emphasizing technical depth and customer interaction. Companies like Notion, Linear, and Amplitude value engineering-minded PMs.

I've set up dual tracking - just say 'switch to PM mode' or 'engineering mode' anytime. Currently showing: Engineering mode (47 active)"

Would it help to:
- Take a short break and return refreshed?
