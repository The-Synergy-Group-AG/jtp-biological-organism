## 1. Technology Stack Recommendations

### 1.1 Framework Comparison Analysis

#### LangChain
**Strengths:**
- Mature ecosystem with extensive documentation
- Rich library of pre-built components and chains
- Strong community support and regular updates
- Excellent integration with various LLMs and vector stores
- Built-in memory management and conversation chains

**Weaknesses:**
- Can be overly complex for simple use cases
- Performance overhead with abstraction layers
- Steeper learning curve for advanced features
- Version updates can break compatibility

**JTP Suitability Score: 8.5/10**

#### CrewAI
**Strengths:**
- Purpose-built for multi-agent orchestration
- Natural role-based agent design
- Excellent for complex, collaborative tasks
- Built-in task delegation and coordination
- Simpler mental model for team-based AI

**Weaknesses:**
- Newer framework with evolving APIs
- Smaller community and ecosystem
- Limited production deployments
- Less flexibility for custom architectures

**JTP Suitability Score: 7.5/10**

#### AutoGen (Microsoft)
**Strengths:**
- Excellent conversational agent capabilities
- Strong autonomous agent features
- Good for complex reasoning tasks
